# __name__ will print the name of the module
print(__name__)


# you can import other files/classes in same folder path hahahaha

# if you import some shit, then the __name__ will print out the name of the class/file imported
# because it's done indirectly and then it'll print out __main__

# to get around printing out bullshit of another file/class, then do an if statement to counter
# ex: if __name__ == "__main__":
#       print fjsdlfjadf

# downloading 3rd party shit
# python3 -m pip install numpy  ##but not in the python shell of vse
# python3 -m pip install matplotlib ##but not in the python shell of vse
# -m pip install numpy
# -m pip install matplotlib
